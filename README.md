Instructions:

The service requires for a MySQL server to be running prior to start up. One way to do this is to start a MySQL instance on port 3306 using XAMPP: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html

The application can be run by navigating to the application folder and running

```
    mvn spring-boot:run
```

Following initialization, navigate to 

```
    localhost:8080
```
